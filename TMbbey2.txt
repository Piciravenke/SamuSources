hello mommy and daddy
I love you
we have a big house
we have a dog
we have a cat
it is monday
we have a bath
it is tuesday
we get a new shoe
it is wednesday
we play ball
it is thursday
mommy read me from a book
it is friday 
we eat a cookie
it is saturday
we see a butterfly
it is sunday
we go grandma 
I will sleep
I eat an organge
my brother laugh at me
he don't like it
he like banana
my sister get a new hat
I love them
thank you mommy and daddy
