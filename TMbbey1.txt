I play all day
I want sleep
my mommy come
we go to bed
my daddy is away
I want a dog
I don't like cats
I'm going to grandma
I want to look my sister
What is this
it is new
mommy will look at it
it is a tree
I laugh
I see many
He is my half brother
I love him
his mommy come 
She give me a bad ball
I want daddy and mommy good again
