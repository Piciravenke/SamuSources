There is a mother called Laura.
She has a son named Peter.
It is a story about their meeting after years.
Laura gets in car, goes to the place where Peter is living.
Peter opens the door.
Says, "Who are you?"
Larua is in tears, says, "I am your mother, son!"
Peter frooze, couldnt say a thing or move.
First thing he said, "Why did you left me?"
L : "I could not raise you up, i thought it was the best decision"
P : "Then why are you here now?"
P : "Missed me? "
L : "Yes, couldnt bear the pain of not seeing you."
L : "I worked nonstop for the past 2 years"
L : "Earned a lof of money, we do not have to worry about it anymore"
P : "You think thats the gonna fill the emptiness that you left?"
L : "I ask for your forgivness"
P : "I can not do such a thing"
Laura is about to walk off when Peter says.
P : "But maybe if time goes by, I can forgive you. Dont go"
P : "Dont leave me again"
Laura stars running to Peter (she is in tears).
They hug each other.
... time passed ... about 1 year ...
They are sitting at a table, talking, and having fun.
They could solve it, Peter was able to forgive her.
Peter is gonna always remember what happened.
Laura is also gonna always remember what happened.
Noone can forget it.
Everyone lived happily until they died.

End of story.
