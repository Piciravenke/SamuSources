The Evil Alien

Once upon a time an alien landed with his spacecraft on Earth.
He traveled to Hungary.
He heard that the most beautiful womens live there.
He also wanted to taste the famous hungarian meals and drinks.
He made a lot of friendship.
He had an easy job.
He was a shapeshifter alien.
He could change his appearance whenever he wanted.
He found out he has to be handsome to get a girl.
He changed his look to a super model male. 
He went to bar.
It was crowded with beautiful woman.
So he picked the nicest and asked her for a date.
They fell in love easily.
After a few months they were expecting a child.
It revealed that they are going to have triplets.
The little aliens became older.
The father wanted to move with his family to his own planet.
His planet was placed in a distant galaxy.
Nobody thought that he has an evil plan to destroy the earth.
Fortunately BÃ¡tfai Samu came alive and saved our planet.
Everybody was celebrating him as the biggest hero of all time.
So the earth stayed a safe place.
The question is: are they still live among us?
