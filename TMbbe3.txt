The ant and the apple.
The ant love an apple.
That red apple has good quality.
It is beautiful.

The red apple is so far from the ant.
The ant still love it.
The distance is unhandable.

The apple is so bad.
The ant feel broken.
The ant took a long road.
It was unnecessary.
The love passed.
The ant don't love the apples now.
Now the ant hate the apple.
In a far land there was a little animal.  
He lived somewhere where no one can see in. 
The animals lived in harmony there.
The little animal was so red and have more brain then anybody else there.
But sometimes he said things what is not true. 
But everyone belief on him.
Then a new family moved in. 
They have a daughter Mila. 
The little animal fall in love on her.
He didn't know how say to her. 
Then he invented her to a walk. 
The little red animal said:
I know who you are.
You are from the government.
I saw you sit near a changer table at the church.
Mila answered:
That was my sister.
I don't work for anyone.
The little animal was surprised.
He didn't said true thing.
The dust came to his face.
His chest was dead.
He can't move.
He was red.
He feared.
He wanted to run.
Mila laughed at him.
You see, others can say no true.
You have a special humor.
I like you.
I like you too.
Said the little red animal.
The worm is angry.
He hate everyone.
He don't have hand.
He was sad because of it.
Everybody laughed at him.
He have a little heart now.
He play with others because he hate them.
He talk with others because he hate them.
He eat dust all day.
He drink from the church's wine.
He thought, it is blood.
The ant have an idea.
The animals will surprise him tomorrow.
He will get a number one company and.
He is still part of the group.
He needs friends.
He needs a society.
Even worms can't live without anyone.
Everybody need company.
He took the things too serious.
The worm was really surprised.
He wanted this secretly.
He got a new umbrella.
He got a grey pencil.
He will start a new farm with the cow.
His best friend now is the fish.
He got his feeling back.
His heart was happy again.
