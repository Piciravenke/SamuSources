The Poor Man And The Three Daugther

Once upon a time lived an old man.
He had three daughters.
One of the girls was amazingly beautiful.
She had a bad quality.
She was very dumb.
The second girl was a little grey mouse.
Nobody noticed her.
She was so silent and boring.
The oldest one was a genius.
She was dreaming in code all the time.
She wrote a bunch of source codes.
She spent her whole day sitting before her computer.
But she was terribly fat.
The girls got old enough.
The poor man told them to find a job.
He always had to pay for clothes for his pretty daughter.
The smart girl needed a lot of food.
He was too tired to work.
The nice girl became a pornstar
She was unhappy.
She didn't even earn a lot of money with that work.
The middle one got a job at a grocery store.
The smartest one took a computer and started to wrote a program.
It made her world famous.
It was named as Bátfai Samu.
So she had a lot of money.
She made his father a rich man and saved her sister from the porn industry.
They lived happily ever after.
